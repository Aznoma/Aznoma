# SQL-Hotel-Bookings_beginner_project

This is the first small SQL project I have made in my data analytics journey.
It focuses on using basic SQL queries to explore data in a dataset of hotels taken from this source: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking>

The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.
